NeSSA: Near-Storage Data Selection for Accelerated Machine Learning Training

File descriptions:
1. resnet_quant : run quantized version on the CPU
2. resnet_quant_gpu: run quantized version on GPU (faster execution)
3. FPGA files: to get predictions from FPGA instead of CPU/GPU
4. runscripts: reproduce results in the paper (cifar10)
